// Let's get Gyarados' sprite!
// We can get our "response" JSON object, then access it with the *value* nested in the *sprite* property:
// response.sprites.versions.generation-iii.firered-leafgreen.front_default: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/versions/generation-iii/firered-leafgreen/130.png"

// ...or, we can look at that value itself (the web address) and look for a pattern:
// https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/versions/generation-iii/firered-leafgreen/130.png
// Gyarados is #130, so we could do a separate call for an image based on that (which is what Erik was doing in Postman)
